title: Resources
---

You define your Kubernetes resources in the `.kubes/resources` folder. Kubes categories items within this folder in 3 main buckets:

* [Role-Based Resource]({% link _docs/resources/role.md %}): Role-based resources. This is your main project resources group in roles.
* [Base Folder]({% link _docs/resources/base.md %}): The base folder contains definitions for common fields that is used for [Layering]({% link _docs/layering.md %}).
* [Shared Resources]({% link _docs/resources/shared.md %}): Shared resources are meanted to be created first and shared by other resources.

In the next sections, we'll cover how these resources are used.
